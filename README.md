# Opioid-Data-Analysis

This repository includes artifacts from a project to analyze the 2014 Opioid Drug data sets available from https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions.

From this information, I created a ShinyApp to display information characterizing the potential relationship between the specialties of practicioners that prescribe opioids and the number of opioids prescribed.  This was further evaluated on a state level.  View the website for more details.
